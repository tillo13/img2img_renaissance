# Image Processing Application

This application is designed to perform various image processing tasks such as image enhancement, transformation, and face detection. The application is structured into different directories and Python files, each serving distinct roles in the image processing pipeline. Below is a comprehensive overview of the application's functionality, directory structure, and detailed descriptions of each Python script.

## Directory Structure

- **Root Directory**: Contains the main Python scripts and subdirectories for organizing images and resources.
- **comparisons**: Stores comparison images of original and enhanced versions.
- **gfpgan**: Contains the GFPGAN model components.
- **gfpgan/weights**: Holds the weights for the GFPGAN model.
- **incoming_images**: Directory for incoming images divided into male and female categories.
  - **incoming_images/female**: Stores incoming images of females.
  - **incoming_images/male**: Stores incoming images of males.
- **model_processed**: Contains processed images generated by the model.
- **output**: Directory for final output images.
- **resources**: Stores resource files needed for image processing, such as landmarks data.

## List of Python Files

1. `enhance_dog.py`
2. `enhance_image.py`
3. `gather_pythons.py`
4. `renaissance_pose.py`

### 1. enhance_dog.py

This script uses a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to modify images based on a prompt. Specifically, it processes an image of a dog to include a cat sitting next to it.

**Key Features**:
- Loads the model and configuration.
- Processes the image according to the specified prompt.
- Saves the modified image to the output directory.

### 2. enhance_image.py

This script enhances images using various image processing techniques such as face detection, sharpening, and denoising.

**Key Features**:
- Downloads necessary models and resources.
- Processes images to enhance quality.
- Saves enhanced images and comparison images for evaluation.

### 3. gather_pythons.py

This script gathers all Python files within a specified root directory, excluding certain subdirectories, and generates a summary of these files.

**Key Features**:
- Scans directories to gather Python files.
- Generates a summary text file containing the list of gathered files and directories.
- Reports excluded directories.

### 4. renaissance_pose.py

This script processes images to create stylized outputs in the form of Renaissance portraits.

**Key Features**:
- Loads and enhances input images.
- Applies the Stable Diffusion model to transform images according to gender-specific prompts.
- Saves the transformed images to the output directory.

## Configuration and Usage

Each script contains configurations and parameters defined at the beginning. These can be adjusted to tailor the processing behavior according to specific requirements.

### Enhancing an Image of a Dog

```shell
python enhance_dog.py

Further Information
This application utilizes several key technologies and libraries:

Torch: For loading and running the pre-trained models.
Pillow: For image manipulation.
Stable Diffusion: For image transformation.
GFPGAN: For face enhancement.
MTCNN: For face detection.
Dlib: For facial landmarks detection.
OpenCV: For image processing techniques like denoising and sharpening.
Ensure all dependencies are installed and resource files are in place before running the scripts.
